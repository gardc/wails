# Building NSIS installer
Windows is currently the only OS supported when it comes to generating installers.

Wails automatically generates a .nsi installer script in `build/windows/installer` on project creation.
To create an installer alongside your Wails binary, you can use the `-nsis` flag with `wails build`:
```
wails build -nsis
```

You will need NSIS installed on your machine. If you use the chocolatey package manager, run the following script:
```
choco install nsis
```

If you install NSIS manually, you need to add the *Bin* folder, which contains `makensis.exe`, in your NSIS installation to your path.
